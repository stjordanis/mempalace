# Cursor IDE Hooks

Three hooks for the [Cursor](https://cursor.com) IDE that save memories
automatically and inject recall context at session start. No manual "save"
commands needed.

These are additive to the existing [Claude Code + Codex hooks](/guide/hooks).
You can run both — they share the same `~/.mempalace/hook_state/`
directory and the same kill switches.

::: tip Pair this with the Cursor plugin
The hooks here only handle the auto-save side. To also get MemPalace's
MCP server, slash commands (`/mempalace-search`, etc.), and the
guided `mempalace` skill, install the bundled
[Cursor plugin](https://github.com/MemPalace/mempalace/blob/main/.cursor-plugin/README.md) —
it's the `.cursor-plugin/` folder at the repo root, dropped into
`~/.cursor/plugins/local/mempalace`. The plugin and the hooks are
orthogonal: install whichever you want, in any order. The plugin
deliberately does **not** wire hooks itself because Cursor's hooks
system is configured per-user/per-project (in `~/.cursor/hooks.json`),
not per-plugin.
:::

## What They Do

| Hook | When It Fires | What Happens |
|------|---------------|--------------|
| **Wake Hook** | `sessionStart` — when a new Cursor conversation opens | Returns `additional_context` telling the agent to recall scoped to the wing inferred from the workspace root. Cursor-only — Claude Code has no equivalent. |
| **Save Hook** | `stop` — after every agent turn | Counts stop invocations per conversation. Every 15 (default), emits a `followup_message` telling the agent to file the session into MemPalace and write a diary entry. |
| **PreCompact Hook** | `preCompact` — right before context compaction | Runs `mempalace mine` synchronously on the transcript before compaction summarises it. Drops a pending-save marker so the next stop forces a save followup. |

**Two-layer capture:** the save and precompact hooks both mine the JSONL
transcript directly into the palace (capturing verbatim tool output — Shell
results, search findings, build errors). The save hook also nudges the AI
to write structured drawers and a diary entry. Belt-and-suspenders.

## Install — Cursor

The fastest path is the installer that ships in the repo.

Preview the change first (writes nothing, just prints the would-be JSON):

```bash
hooks/cursor/install.sh --scope user --dry-run
```

User scope — applies globally, writes `~/.cursor/hooks.json`:

```bash
hooks/cursor/install.sh --scope user
```

Or project scope — only this repo, writes `<repo>/.cursor/hooks.json`:

```bash
hooks/cursor/install.sh --scope project --target /path/to/your/repo
```

The installer copies the three hook scripts to `~/.mempalace/hooks/cursor/`,
merges the entries into your `hooks.json`, and preserves any unrelated
hooks already in that file. Re-running is idempotent. Pass `--variant
minimal` for the `stop`-only setup, or `--uninstall` to remove the
MemPalace entries (leaves other hooks intact).

### Manual install — `~/.cursor/hooks.json` (user scope)

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "hooks": {
    "sessionStart": [
      { "command": "/absolute/path/to/hooks/cursor/mempal_wake_hook_cursor.sh" }
    ],
    "stop": [
      {
        "command": "/absolute/path/to/hooks/cursor/mempal_save_hook_cursor.sh",
        "loop_limit": 1
      }
    ],
    "preCompact": [
      { "command": "/absolute/path/to/hooks/cursor/mempal_precompact_hook_cursor.sh" }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Manual install — `.cursor/hooks.json` (project scope)

Identical content. Project hooks load in any trusted workspace and are
checked into version control with the project. Cloud agents also load
project hooks.

Make the scripts executable once:

```bash
chmod +x hooks/cursor/mempal_save_hook_cursor.sh \
         hooks/cursor/mempal_precompact_hook_cursor.sh \
         hooks/cursor/mempal_wake_hook_cursor.sh
```

Cursor watches `hooks.json` and reloads automatically after a save. If
hooks still do not fire, restart Cursor and check the Hooks panel in
Settings → Hooks.

## Configuration

All knobs are environment variables. Defaults match the Claude Code hooks
where they overlap.

- **`MEMPAL_SAVE_INTERVAL=15`** — number of `stop` events between save
  followups. Lower = more frequent saves, higher = less interruption.
- **`MEMPAL_STATE_DIR`** — where the hook keeps counter files, the
  pending-save marker, and `cursor_hook.log`. Defaults to
  `~/.mempalace/hook_state/`.
- **`MEMPAL_DIR`** — optional project directory (code, notes, docs) to
  also mine on each save trigger, with `--mode projects`. The transcript
  is always mined regardless — `MEMPAL_DIR` is purely additive.
- **`MEMPAL_PYTHON`** — path to a Python 3 interpreter. The hook's own
  JSON parsing and the install script's JSON merge use this. Resolution
  order: `$MEMPAL_PYTHON` → `command -v python3` → bare `python3`. Set
  this when Cursor is launched from a GUI on macOS and the inherited
  PATH lacks the Python where you installed MemPalace.
- **`MEMPAL_DISABLE_HOOK=1`** — emergency kill switch. Disables all
  three hooks; they emit `{}` and exit 0.
- **`MEMPALACE_HOOKS_AUTO_SAVE=false`** — same effect as
  `MEMPAL_DISABLE_HOOK=1`. Also honoured via `~/.mempalace/config.json`:

  ```json
  { "hooks": { "auto_save": false } }
  ```

## How It Works

### Wake Hook (`sessionStart`)

```
Cursor opens new conversation → sessionStart fires
                                       ↓
                          Hook reads workspace_roots[0]
                                       ↓
                          Infers wing = basename(workspace_root)
                                       ↓
                {"additional_context": "scope recall to wing=<...>"}
                                       ↓
                Agent reads additional_context before first turn
                                       ↓
                Agent calls mempalace_search + mempalace_diary_read
                wing-scoped on the first relevant question
```

Cursor's `sessionStart` is fire-and-forget — the agent loop does not wait
for a blocking response and does not consume `continue` / `user_message`.
But it does honour `additional_context`, and that is the only field
MemPalace emits.

### Save Hook (`stop` event)

```
User sends message → agent responds → Cursor fires stop hook
                                              ↓
                              Hook reads loop_count from stdin
                                              ↓
                  ┌─── loop_count > 0 (our own followup running) ──→ echo "{}"
                  │
                  └─── loop_count == 0
                                  ↓
                       Check pending-save marker from preCompact
                                  ↓
                   ┌── marker present ──→ delete + emit followup_message
                   │
                   └── no marker
                                  ↓
                  Atomic counter++ for this conversation_id
                                  ↓
              ┌── counter % SAVE_INTERVAL != 0 ──→ echo "{}"
              │
              └── counter % SAVE_INTERVAL == 0
                                  ↓
                 Background: mempalace mine <transcript_dir>
                                  ↓
                  Emit {"followup_message": "save key topics..."}
                                  ↓
                  Cursor auto-submits followup as next user turn
                                  ↓
                  Agent files drawers + writes diary
                                  ↓
                  Agent stops; stop fires again with loop_count = 1
                                  ↓
                  Hook sees loop_count > 0 → echo "{}" → agent stops
```

The `loop_count > 0` short-circuit prevents infinite loops: emit once →
agent saves → stops → we see `loop_count = 1` → we let it through. This
is the Cursor equivalent of Claude Code's `stop_hook_active` flag. The
`loop_limit: 1` in `hooks.json` is defense-in-depth on top.

### PreCompact Hook

```
Context window near full → Cursor fires preCompact (observational)
                                       ↓
                Synchronously: mempalace mine <transcript_dir>
                                       ↓
                Drop pending-save marker for this conversation_id
                                       ↓
                {"user_message": "transcript snapshotted..."}
                                       ↓
                Compaction proceeds (we cannot block it)
                                       ↓
                Next stop event picks up the marker → forces save
```

Cursor's `preCompact` is documented as **observational only** — its only
output field is `user_message`, with no `followup_message` and no way to
block. That is fundamentally different from Claude Code's `PreCompact`
which can block until the AI has saved. We work around the limitation by
mining the verbatim transcript synchronously (zero LLM cost) and queueing
a save nudge for the next agent turn.

## Cursor-only extras

The features below are not available in the Claude Code or Codex hooks
because their hook surfaces do not expose the necessary events.

- **Session-start recall via `sessionStart`.** The wake hook injects
  wing-scoped recall guidance into the conversation's initial system
  context, so the agent searches the palace before answering anything
  that touches past work. Verified output field — see the [Cursor hooks
  reference](https://cursor.com/docs/hooks.md) section "sessionStart".
- **Per-script `loop_limit`.** Cursor's `loop_limit` (default 5,
  configurable per script) is a hard cap on how many auto-followups
  Cursor will issue. MemPalace sets it to `1` in the example
  `hooks.json` as defense-in-depth on top of its own `loop_count`
  check.
- **Inferred wing from `workspace_roots`.** Both the wake hook and the
  save hook use `basename(workspace_roots[0])` to scope memory
  operations. A user with multiple Cursor workspaces gets per-project
  wings without any manual configuration.

## Debugging

```bash
cat ~/.mempalace/hook_state/cursor_hook.log
```

Example output (ISO-8601 timestamps, event + conversation id, message):

```
[2026-05-27T02:16:01Z] [event=sessionStart] [conv=abc123] workspace=/Users/me/proj wing=proj
[2026-05-27T02:21:33Z] [event=stop]         [conv=abc123] counter 0 -> 1 (interval=15)
[2026-05-27T02:42:09Z] [event=stop]         [conv=abc123] counter 14 -> 15 (interval=15)
[2026-05-27T02:42:09Z] [event=stop]         [conv=abc123] TRIGGERING SAVE at counter=15
[2026-05-27T02:42:11Z] [event=stop]         [conv=abc123] loop_count>0; letting agent stop
[2026-05-27T03:05:44Z] [event=preCompact]   [conv=abc123] trigger=auto transcript=/Users/me/.cursor/.../transcript.txt
[2026-05-27T03:05:46Z] [event=stop]         [conv=abc123] consumed pending-save marker (post-compaction)
```

When a hook can't parse its stdin (corrupt payload, future Cursor schema
change), the raw input — capped at 4096 bytes, mode 0600 — lands at:

```
~/.mempalace/hook_state/cursor_last_input.log
~/.mempalace/hook_state/cursor_last_python_err.log
```

Both are overwritten on each failure, never appended, so a repeating
misconfiguration cannot grow disk usage.

## Cost

**Zero extra tokens.** The hooks are bash scripts that run locally. They
do not call any API. The `followup_message` the save hook emits is a
normal user turn — it counts the same as any other user message and does
not invoke any extra LLM call beyond the one the user would otherwise
make.

## Known limitations

- **Hooks load at session start.** Cursor watches `hooks.json` and reloads
  the wiring when the file changes, but for the freshly-loaded hook
  scripts to take effect on an existing conversation you usually have to
  start a new conversation. This matches the behaviour of Claude Code's
  hook lifecycle.
- **`preCompact` cannot block.** See the diagram above. The
  pending-save marker is the workaround.
- **Transcript file format is opaque.** Cursor does not document the
  schema of the file at `transcript_path`. MemPalace's `mempalace mine`
  command handles it via its normaliser layer; the hooks themselves never
  parse the transcript directly.
